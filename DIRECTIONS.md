## Hello Team Valiant!

So I've put together the user interface for a calculator in react and I'd like 
you guys to finish the logic. Mainly I want to test our ability to submit PR's 
and don't worry if you have any trouble feel liberated to reach out.

## Our Future Together

Once we iron out our teamwork I'll fetch you a live contract and we can scale 
from there. I'm looking forward to working with each of you, I think we can do 
big things together.

## My Technology Forecast

We are in a golden age of programming, particularly contract work but I sense it 
won't last much longer than 15 years with ai/ml progressing as quickly as it is. 
That's why we're going to focus on working towards data science type contracts 
eventually, I'm still very much learning it myself.

## Personal Philosophy

All I ask is you don't work yourself to death, I'm guilty of that. Spend time with 
friends and family, create memories instead of sitting in front of a screen because 
life is too short not to.
